# üé≤ TableTop Games Assistant: Dice Roller

A simple and efficient **Dice Roller** app for tabletop games, allowing you to simulate dice rolls with various dice sizes, closely mimicking real-world behavior.

---

## üöÄ Building the App

It is recommended to use the [Qt Online Installer](https://www.qt.io/download) to download **Qt** and related tools. While the app builds and runs on non-Android devices, it may not appear the same due to DPI differences.

For easier experience, use **Qt Creator** or **Android Studio's SDK Manager** to set up Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) for running/testing. You can also test directly on your physical Android device.

---

### üîß Prerequisites

To build the project, you will need:
- **Qt for Android**
- **Android Development Enviroment** (described later)
- **An AVD or a Physical Device** 

---

## üì± Setting Up an AVD in Qt Creator

Follow these steps to configure an Android emulator:

1. Open **Qt Creator** and navigate to `Edit ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Devices ‚Üí Android`.
2. Download the required tools either manually or use the provided buttons to let Qt Creator handle it. The **JDK** setup, however, must be done manually.
3. Ensure that all the checks below **Android NDK List** are green-ticked.
4. Click `SDK Manager` and download an appropriate Android system image (not too old, Android 10+ recommended).
5. Restart Qt Creator to apply changes.
6. Go back to the **Device** tab and click `Add ‚Üí Android Device`. Enter the correct details for the image you downloaded.
7. After adding a device, the **Kits** will be available in the `Projects` tab (left sidebar).
8. Under `Projects ‚Üí Build Steps ‚Üí Build Android APK`, you can customize the Manifest file (do NOT replace it, if you've no idea about it) through `Create Template` or you can find it at `<Project> -> android`.
9. Provide a **KeyStore file** for signing the APK:
   - Use the debug KeyStore at `C:\Users\<UserName>\.android\debug.keystore` (provided by Qt Creator for debugging), or create your own (MUST, if you're publishing).
   - Check the `Sign Package` option.
10. In the **Build and Kit Configuration** dropdown (above the "Run" button), ensure the correct device is selected and go ahead with the build.

## üì≤ Setting Up Your Android Device

To test the app directly on a physical Android device:

1. Go to `Settings ‚Üí About Phone` and repeatedly tap the **OS version** until you enable Developer Mode.
2. Navigate to `Developer Options ‚Üí Debugging` and enable:
   - **USB Debugging**
   - **Install via USB**
3. Follow Steps **8, 9, and 10** from the [AVD Setup](#setting-up-an-avd-in-qt-creator) section.
